[DNX.Helpers.CommandLine](http://github.com/martinsmith1968/DNX.Helpers.CommandLine) is a .NET package that contains the bits that help working with the excellent [Command Line parser](http://github.com/commandlineparser/commandline) library from Giacomo Stelluti Scala.

> Note:
> This package is currently based around [v2.1.1-beta](https://github.com/gsscoder/commandline/wiki/Latest-Version) which is yet to be officially released but contains all the functionality I'm interesting in building upon.
